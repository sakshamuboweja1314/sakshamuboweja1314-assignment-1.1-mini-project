Project- Superstore Sales Analysis

Superstore Sales Analysis
Introduction
This project analyzes the "Sample – Superstore" dataset to uncover patterns in sales, profit, and regional performance. The workflow combined Python for data cleaning with Microsoft Power BI for visualization, resulting in an interactive dashboard that supports data-driven insights.

Data Source
The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains detailed records of orders, products, customers, and shipping for a fictional retail store. It serves as a comprehensive source for exploring sales trends and operational efficiency.

Data Cleaning and Preparation (Python)
Raw data required preprocessing before analysis. Using Python’s pandas library, the following steps were performed:
Loading the CSV file into a DataFrame.
Removing duplicate entries to maintain accuracy.
Handling missing values by replacing absent postal codes with the most frequently occurring ones.

BI Analysis and Visualization (Power BI)
The cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI for further refinement. Final adjustments, such as correcting inconsistent state names, were completed in Power Query Editor. An interactive dashboard was then developed to analyze:
Sales and profit by region and state.
Performance of product categories.
Customer segment behavior.

Conclusion
By integrating Python and Power BI, the project transformed raw data into actionable insights. The dashboard provides a clear view of business performance, helping identify profitable regions, customer trends, and product strengths.
